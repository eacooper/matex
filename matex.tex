\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

We collected \numSamples{} samples in the \conditionNamesA{} and \conditionNamesB{} conditions.

\section{Results}

We performed a paired t-test to determine if there was a significant difference between the means of the two conditions (\conditionNamesA{} M = \meansA{}, \conditionNamesB{} M = \meansB{}, {\emph{p} = \p{}).
